          <p>As California faces a record-breaking drought, it's up to all of us to decrease our water consumption. It's difficult for residential water consumers to understand the impact that small changes make on their total water consumption, and we want to make that easier.</p>

          <p>We also believe that with a problem this big, it's easy for people to assume someone else will take responsibility for the solution. By engaging at a community or organizational level, we hope people can see the impact that working together can have on the water supply.</p>
